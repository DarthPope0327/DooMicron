# DooMicron
Doom Micron mods by Doom Discord community

Base build parts should be gotten from the printers for ants github. https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Micron These parts are for modifications to turn the Micron 180 version into a Doom Cube variant.

If you are using the Rounded Corner extrusions these are found in the DFH extrusions and panels file
If you are using 151530 square corner extrusions you will replace the Front and Rear skirts on the top and bottom with the files in the Square Corner Extrusion Skirts file as well as the top and bottom trims and corner brackets all other files are the same as the ones in the DFH folder.
